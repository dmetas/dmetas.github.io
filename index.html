	<p>Eyeglasses have been around for a very long time. The material of the lenses and frames have changed over the years but the purpose has never changed <b>(to improve vision)</b>.

	<h2>evaluating antiquespectacles.com</h2>
<p>This website (<a href="http://www.antiquespectacles.com/history/ages/through_the_ages.htm">here</a>) has some interesting html atributes such as align and "bgcolor" that I hadnt seen before. The overall appearance of this website could use some work. Some major issues are that some elements on the website overlap other elements so they cant be read. It also seems to have some issues when resizing the webpage. </p>
